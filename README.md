## Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng - 2026 ver
This repository contains curated resources and programming assignments from the Deep Learning Specialization course by DeepLearning.AI (2026) - Prof. Andrew Ng

## Programming Assignments
### [Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning][C1]
> The first course in the Deep Learning Specialization focuses on the foundational concepts of neural networks and deep learning. We will learn about the key technology trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to applications.

- [Week 2 - A1: Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset][C1W2A1]
- [Week 3 - A1: Planar data classification with one hidden layer][C1W3A1]
- [Week 4 - A1: Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step][C1W4A1]
- [Week 4 - A2: Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application][C1W4A2]

### [Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization][C2]
> The second course in the Deep Learning Specialization focuses on opening the black box of deep learning to understand the processes that drive performance and systematically generate good results. We will learn best practices for training and developing test sets and analyzing bias/variance for building deep learning applications; be able to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking; implement and apply various optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop, and Adam, and check for their convergence; and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.

- [Week 1 - A1: Initialization][C2W1A1]
- [Week 1 - A2: Regularization][C2W1A2]
- [Week 1 - A3: Gradient Checking][C2W1A3]
- [Week 2 - A1: Optimization Methods][C2W2A1]
- [Week 3 - A1: TensorFlow Tutorial][C2W3A1]

### [Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects][C3]
> The third course in the Deep Learning Specialization focuses on learning how to build a successful machine learning project and practicing decision making as a machine learning project leader. We will learn how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system; prioritize strategies to reduce errors; understand complex ML settings such as mismatched training/test sets and comparing to and/or outperforming human performance; and apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning. This is also a standalone course for learners who have basic knowledge of machine learning. This course draws on Andrew Ng's experience building and shipping many deep learning products. If you aspire to become a technical leader who can set the direction for an AI team, this course provides the "industry experience" that you might otherwise only get after years of ML work experience.

There are no programming assignments for this course.

- Week 1: Machine Learning Strategies 1
- Week 2: Machine Learning Strategies 2

### [Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks][C4]
> The fourth course in the Deep Learning Specialization focuses on understanding how computer vision has evolved and becoming familiar with its exciting applications, such as autonomous driving, face recognition, reading radiology images, and more. We will learn how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks; apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks; and use neural style transfer to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.

I know some people are struggling to finish the course (including myself) as it takes time to understand new concepts, build intuition, and debug the programming assignment. The uploaded files here are for reference. They are meant to help you only if you are stuck.

If you find this repository helpful, please give a star. Thank you ^_^
